Steps to run the code
1) Form the Training File, the first part of the code produces feature engineering data from the train_final and test_final.csv files.   
2) Once done. Copy the new feature files for train and test, and apply them to the second part of the Training file code  script.  Make sure to True and FAlse the models used for training, FOor our case, only VAE was True.
3) Define the seed numbers and run to train.   All files generated will be saved in the Kaggle directory.



# Real-time
Based on the files found and needed for the code, put their correct directory and run.  Now one might face a no module error because it needs a lot of modules to be installed. Once done it willl run
